# The Great Mobile Race (2009)

A web toy for racing hot air balloons and mobiles in the browser (works best in Firefox). [Live Demo](http://play.killglare.com/race.html) 

### About
I wrote this web toy in 2009 when I was learning jQuery.  It's inspired in part by After Dark's [Rat Race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNZ6kEH63t8) screensaver.  As kids, we would take bets on which rat would win the race, and cheer them on as they wandered, sometimes infuriatingly, around the track towards the cheese.


#### Future
Web technologies (and my programmin' skills) have come a long way since 2009, and so this project requires some work.  

I have plans to add additional mobiles to the race.  The amazingly talented  illustrator [Max Wittert](http://home.maxwittert.com/) has made a number of delightful sketches for this project.  As of today, they are still sitting in the images directory, waiting to be integrated.
